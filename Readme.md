# MLOps Churn Prediction Project

This project is an **MLOps churn prediction pipeline** designed to predict which customers are likely to leave a service, helping businesses take proactive retention measures. It implements an **end-to-end workflow** including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model versioning. Built with **Python**, using **pandas** and **numpy** for data processing, **scikit-learn** for machine learning, **joblib** for saving models, and **logging** for pipeline tracking, the project is currently functional on a mini dataset and will be further enhanced with logging, metrics saving, and automation in future updates.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Work in Progress** – Current functionality includes:

- Data ingestion from CSV files
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
- Model training (Logistic Regression)
- Model evaluation with metrics
- Model saving and versioning

✅ Pipeline is fully functional on the mini dataset.  
Next steps: implement logging, save evaluation metrics, handle larger datasets, and add automation for a professional MLOps workflow.
